# Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2025-10-03

SkyBook ("the app") is developed by Hyperion Dev Studio. This policy describes how the app collects and uses information when you use it.

## Information We Collect

The app does not require you to create an account and does not collect personally identifiable information. All quiz history, settings, hearts and achievements are stored locally on your device using the standard Android or iOS storage mechanism (`SharedPreferences`).

### Advertising Data

The app uses Google Mobile Ads to provide rewarded advertisements. Google may collect device information (such as the advertising ID) to serve and measure ads. Please refer to [Google's privacy policies](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads) for details on the data they collect and how it is used.

## How We Use Information

Locally stored data is used solely to track your progress, preferences and hearts. We do not transmit this information off the device.

Advertising data handled by Google is used only to provide rewards for viewing ads and to improve ad performance.

If you choose to contact us via the Feedback screen, your email address and any information you provide will be used solely to respond to your inquiry.

## Third‑Party Services

- Google Mobile Ads

These services may collect information as described above. We do not control the data collected by third‑party services, but we do not send any additional personal data to them.

## Data Retention

Data stored on your device persists until you uninstall the app or clear the app's data. We do not retain any personal information on our servers.

## Children

The app is intended for general audiences. If you are under the age required by your jurisdiction to consent to data processing, please use the app under the supervision of a parent or guardian.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in this document, and a new effective date will be indicated at the top of the policy.
